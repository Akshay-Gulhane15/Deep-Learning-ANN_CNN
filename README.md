# Deep-Learning-ANN_CNN

In this project ANN model is build on the Prediction of HR Interview Analysis and Video Game SalesmAnalysis and CNN Model is build on Cats & Dogs Image Classification.

Task 1 :-
Use the Dataset named HR Interview Analytics to predict the Status of the candidate (0 is not accepted and 1 is accepted). Build an Artificial Neural Network to predict the Status.


Task 2 :-
Use the below given url to build a CNN model to predict whether the given image is dog or cat. You can use Kaggle notebooks to build the model. Once the model is build, take a random image of a cat or dog from the test data and predict it using the model.


Task 3 :-
Use the dataset named video_game_sales to predict the global sales, using artificial neural network. Use appropriate data preprocessing techniques to clean the data.
